<span class="firstcharacter">**spatPomp**</span> concerns inference for nonlinear partially-observed Markov process models having a spatial unit structure in addition to the temporal Markovian property of the latent process.
Such a model is called a SpatPOMP.
For example, ecological metapopulation models consist of spatial units corresponding to distinct, interacting sub-populations.
Each unit may itself consist of multiple interacting species.
In **spatPomp**, models can be represented by specifying the latent dynamic process and how it is measured.
The **spatPomp** package builds on **pomp**, and its base class, `spatPomp` extends the **pomp** class `pomp`.
Therefore, all algorithms and methods provided by **pomp** are accessible in **spatPomp**.
However, practical analysis of high-dimensional systems can take advantage of the additional unit structure that POMP models do not necessarily possess.

Algorithms currently provided by  **spatPomp** include the following:

- Guided intermediate resampling filter, `girf`
- Block particle filter, `bpfilter`
- Adapted bagged filter, `abf`
- Ensemble Kalman filter, `enkf`
- Iterated GIRF for parameter estimation, `igirf`
- Iterated bpfilter for parameter estimation, `ibpf`
- Iterated ensemble Kalman filter for parameter estimation, `ienkf`

In addition, the particle filter provided by [**pomp**](https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/) as `pfilter` and the corresponding iterated filter, `mif2`, are useful for validating **spatPomp** models and workflows on small subsets the spatial units.

**spatPomp** is currently in development. All are welcome to contribute methods or models, or any other feedback.   Please let the developers know if you find **spatPomp** useful and if you publish results obtained using it!

The latest development version of **spatPomp** is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/kidusasfaw/spatPomp) and versions are occasionally uploaded to [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/spatPomp). Other relevant resources are:
