This is a temporary branch used to prepare and submit a paper
on spatPomp to Journal of Open Source Software.

After publication, this can be put in a sub-directory of the master branch.

To use docker to put the manuscript into JOSS format

docker run --rm -it \
        -v $PWD:/data \
        -u $(id -u):$(id -g) \
        openjournals/inara \
        -o pdf,crossref \
        paper.md

or, compressed into one line,

docker run --rm -it  -v $PWD:/data  -u $(id -u):$(id -g)  openjournals/inara  -o pdf,crossref paper.md

which can be set up as an alias, joss. On Mac, the Docker app has to be running to start the docker daemon required for docker run.
