\arguments{
\item{Nabf}{The number of iterations to perform}

\item{Np}{the number of particles to use.
This may be specified as a single positive integer, in which case the same number of particles will be used at each timestep.
Alternatively, if one wishes the number of particles to vary across timesteps, one may specify \code{Np} either as a vector of positive integers of length \preformatted{length(time(object,t0=TRUE))} or as a function taking a positive integer argument.
In the latter case, \code{Np(k)} must be a single positive integer, representing the number of particles to be used at the \code{k}-th timestep:
\code{Np(0)} is the number of particles to use going from \code{timezero(object)} to \code{time(object)[1]},
\code{Np(1)}, from \code{timezero(object)} to \code{time(object)[1]},
and so on,
while when \code{T=length(time(object))}, \code{Np(T)} is the number of particles to sample at the end of the time-series.}

\item{rw.sd}{specification of the magnitude of the random-walk perturbations that will be applied to some or all model parameters.
Parameters that are to be estimated should have positive perturbations specified here.
The specification is given using the \code{\link[pomp]{rw.sd}} function, which creates a list of unevaluated expressions.
The latter are evaluated in a context where the model time variable is defined (as \code{time}).
The expression \code{ivp(s)} can be used in this context as shorthand for \preformatted{ifelse(time==time[1],s,0).}
Likewise, \code{ivp(s,lag)} is equivalent to \preformatted{ifelse(time==time[lag],s,0).}
See below for some examples.

The perturbations that are applied are normally distributed with the specified s.d.
If parameter transformations have been supplied, then the perturbations are applied on the transformed (estimation) scale.}

\item{cooling.type}{specifications for the cooling schedule,
i.e., the manner and rate with which the intensity of the parameter perturbations is reduced with successive filtering iterations.
\code{cooling.type} specifies the nature of the cooling schedule.
See below (under \dQuote{Specifying the perturbations}) for more detail.}

\item{cooling.fraction.50}{specifications for the cooling schedule,
i.e., the manner and rate with which the intensity of the parameter perturbations is reduced with successive filtering iterations.
\code{cooling.type} specifies the nature of the cooling schedule.
See below (under \dQuote{Specifying the perturbations}) for more detail.}

\item{verbose}{logical; if \code{TRUE}, diagnostic messages will be printed to the console.}

\item{...}{additional arguments supply new or modify existing model characteristics or components.
See \code{\link[pomp]{pomp}} for a full list of recognized arguments.

When named arguments not recognized by \code{\link[pomp]{pomp}} are provided, these are made available to all basic components via the so-called \dfn{userdata} facility.
This allows the user to pass information to the basic components outside of the usual routes of covariates (\code{covar}) and model parameters (\code{params}).
See \link[pomp:userdata]{?userdata} for information on how to use this facility.}

\value{
Upon successful completion, \code{iabf} returns an object of class
\sQuote{iabfd_spatPomp}.
}
\description{
An algorithm for estimating the parameters of a spatiotemporal partially-observed Markov process.
Running \code{iabf} causes the algorithm to perform a specified number of iterations of adapted simulations with parameter perturbation and parameter resamplings.
At each iteration, adapted simulations are performed on a perturbed version of the model, in which the parameters to be estimated are subjected to random perturbations at each observation.
After cycling through the data, each replicate's weight is calculated and is used to rank the bootstrap replictates. The highest ranking replicates are recycled into the next iteration.
This extra variability introduced through parameter perturbation effectively smooths the likelihood surface and combats particle depletion by introducing diversity into particle population.
As the iterations progress, the magnitude of the perturbations is diminished according to a user-specified cooling schedule.
